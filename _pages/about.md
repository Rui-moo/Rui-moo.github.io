Rui Mo is from Chongqing, China. He obtained his Bachelor's degree in Environmental Engineering at [Changchun University of Technology](https://www.ccut.edu.cn/) for four years. During that period, He was working with Prof. [Xudong Yang](https://teacher.ccut.edu.cn/yangxudong/zh_CN/index.htm) about the preparation of carbonized polymer dots based on biomass and the detection of silver ions in water.later, He obtained his Master's degree in Resources and Environment at [China Agricultural University](https://www.cau.edu.cn/) for two years, working with Prof. [Changwei Zhao](http://faculty.cau.edu.cn/zyhjxy/zzw/list.psp), embarking on the preparation and properties of functional molybdenum disulfide composite nanofiltration membrane.

Currently, He is a research assistant at the School of Resources and Environment, China Agricultural University, working on membrane and separation with Prof. [Changwei Zhao](http://faculty.cau.edu.cn/zyhjxy/zzw/list.psp)..

My research interest includes membrane separation and funcational materials. I have published several papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=wvKh4P8AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top journal such as Nature Communications.
